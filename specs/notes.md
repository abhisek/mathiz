# Notes

These are my notes on building this project almost entirely using Claude Code. I did minimal coding.
I focussed on the domain of the problem, making decision as per my

## Concepts

## AI Native

This is more of an experiment. AI is not required here to overcome any limitation of conventional

learn context engineering and figure out if we can engineer the context around an AI in a way where
it produces questions, evaluates answers, tracks progress, makes decisions about how to improve the
skill of a learner.
